        API Polling 
               Ui request data server sends data 
               Uni Directional 
               has interval 
               ui can keep checking after few seconds to get data 
        Example Email - Polling delay is fine 
        Example Stock ,crypto market app,whatsap - Web Sockets 
        Even youtube uses api polling and the comments might not be in order because it makes call after some interval 
        Makes so many Youtube live api calls so many and page doesnt freez because of so many divs aded why? 

        Why Does page doesnt freeze?
        We think youtube keep pushing everything NO IF IT DID THAT EXPLODE DOM AND PAGE SIZE IS INCREASED

        Because once message reacehs certain number it cleans up from page very fast 
        So when many messages are on stack and we are on top message it wont delete it 

        More Smart when we are in mac it changes the number of items it can be seen increases
        It configures diffrent ui based on diffrent browsers
       

       Polling - setInterval
